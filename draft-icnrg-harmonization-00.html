</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">NDN and CCNx 1.0 are two prominent realizations of the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) vision. Both realizations share the same root of Content Centric Networking (CCN) design introduced by <a href="http://www.ccnx.org/395/1/van-jacobsen-at-google/">Van Jacobson in 2006</a>.  CCNx, from versions 0.1 to 0.8 (referred to as CCNx 0.x in the rest of this draft), was the name of the software router and libraries developed and maintained by PARC. Although the protocol architecture was renamed to NDN when the effort got funded under NSF&#8217;s Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program in 2010 (with PARC being one of the ten funded institutions), the NDN project used CCNx 0.x as its implementation in its first two years of operation, and PARC provided the codebase support to meet the research needs for the rest of the project team.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">In October 2012, PARC parted the way from the rest of the NDN project team in (interested readers may take a look at <a href="https://named-data.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/NDN-IPR.pdf">the related causes</a>). In 2013 PARC introduced a significantly re-designed, non-backward-compatible protocol CCNx 1.0, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2017.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">In parallel, the NDN project team has been continuing to refine the NDN protocol derived from the original CCNx 0.x design, guided by the <a href="https://named-data.net/project/ndn-design-principles/">NDN protocol design principles</a> and based on experimentation results.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The objective of this document is to summarize the shared commonalities between the latest versions of NDN and CCNx 1.0 realizations, identify points of divergence, and documents reasons behind these different design choices. The identified commonalities and differences serve as a starting point to an open discussion to determine possibility to harmonize the two realizations, and if determined so, provide a general guidance on how to achieve it.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">RFC 2119</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">ICN terms used in this document are interpreted as described in <a href="#I-D.wissingh-icnrg-terminology" class="xref">[I-D.wissingh-icnrg-terminology]</a>.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">A note of notation first: the CCNx 0.x documents use the word &#8220;message" to refer to packet. CCNx 1.0 gives distinctive and different definitions to &#8220;messsage" and &#8220;packet". To avoid confusion, the following uses the word packet in CCNx 0.x description.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.1">CCNx 0.x defines a variable-length encoding format using binary XML encoding (ccnb). This encoding defines all packet formats by XML schemas with explicitly identified field boundaries. This protocol format design permits field values of arbitrary length, nested structures, and optional fields that consume no packet space when omitted.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1.2">3.1.2.</a> <a href="#name" id="name">Name</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.1">CCNx 0.x defines a hierarchical naming structure, each component in a name can be an arbitrary length sequence of zero or more bytes. Encoding of the name follows the overall packet format, i.e., represented on wire as binary-encoded XML.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.2">In addition to an explicitly defined sequence of name components, the name of each Data packet includes an additional implicitly appended name component: the implicit digest. This component contains the raw bytes of the SHA-256 digest of the entire ccnb-encoded Data.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.3">CCNx 0.x also defines a set of naming conventions on how to encode various information as part of the name, including binary data, versions, segments, meta-data header, and commands.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.4.p.3">CCNx 0.8 codebase uses <a href="https://redmine.named-data.net/projects/nfd/wiki/CcndStrategy">"two-best route then flood" strategy</a>. Each forwarder for each name prefix in its FIB keeps an estimate of the round-trip time.  If an Interest goes unsatisfied longer than this estimate, the forwarder either looks up the second best FIB entry (if exists) and forwards the Interest there (first timeout) or sends Interests to the remaining FIB entries (if any). The intention of this approach is to adaptively explore available paths and retrieve Data, taking advantage of CCNx 0.8 design to prevent Interest loops through PIT state and Nonce mechanisms.  The estimate is initialized to a hard-coded value between 8 and 12 msec and uses multiplicative increase multiplicative decrease approach with constant 1/128 to adjust it after receiving Data (decrease to t = 0.992 * t) or upon timeout (increase to t = 1.125 t). This means that about every 8th Interest will trigger a timeout and sending on the second best path. This infrequent use of the second best path updates that path's RTT estimate.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.4.p.4">The CCNx 0.x forwarder uses a set of flags on FIB entries called Child Inherit and Forward Capture [cite NFD dev guide?]. By default, the FIB matching takes a strict longest prefix matching approach. If the Child Inherit flag is set on a shorter prefix, it indicates that shorter prefixes should be considered equally feasible as the longer matching prefixes. The Forward Capture flag on a shorter prefix indicates that no longer prefix should be used (it avoids another process from "capturing" the FIB entry by making a longer entry).  The use of these two flags has a strong interaction with the "two-best route then flood" forwarding strategy, as they either expand or contract the set of feasible routes used in Interest forwarding and Interest timeout retransmission.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.1">In the beginning of 2013, PARC team has undertaken a significant revision of CCNx (CCNx 1.0), refactoring the protocol behavior and packet format.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.2">The following list is a high-level summary of the changes.  </p>
<p><strong>Semantics</strong> </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The semantics of data retrieval got constrained to retrieval by "exact" or "full" names only. The advantage of this change is significant simplification of the forwarding process, allowing various hardware and software optimization techniques (?cite?). At the same time, the communication using the constrained semantics requires additional mechanism and semantics changes. The full (and some exact) names must be explicitly communicated to the consumers by an out-of-band (e.g., an application-level name discovery, such as manifests and directory service) mechanisms. To bootstrap these mechanism required changes of "immutable data" semantics: the same name need to be associated with different content at different times with time-dependency on the network routers to removing "old" versions from the network.  </li>
<li>Interest aggregation </li>
<li>Data packet semantics changed from fresh/stale to alive/dead: added a requirement on in-network caches to stop serving data for interests after producer-defined time ("time-dependent" immutability) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encoding</strong>: </p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>The XML binary encoding replaced with "Type-Length-Value" (TLV) encoding, with <samp>Type</samp> and <samp>Length</samp> encoded using a fixed 2-octet encoding. A separate specialized IoT version (requires translation) of CCNx 1.0 (?cite?) added a 1-octet encoding of combined T-V fields.  </li></ul>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Name changed to be a two-level nested TLV, outer TLV and "typed" name components sub-TLVs </li>
<li>Introduced free-to-define name component types </li>
<li>Implicit digest changed from being a part of the name (implicitly added name component, ensuring uniqueness of the full name) to be an independent identifier that can be used as part of "hash restriction".  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Packet Types</strong> </p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Added <samp>InterestReturn</samp> packet </li></ul>
<p><strong>Interest Packet</strong> </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Introduced a "fixed" common header, with optional TLV-encoded hop-by-hop headers (not covered by signature), followed by TLV-encoded Interest packet.  </li>
<li>Introduced "HopLimit" (as part of fixed header) </li>
<li>
<samp>Nonce</samp> removed (killing loops via HopLimit, no detection of loops) </li>
<li>
<samp>MinSuffixComponents</samp>, <samp>MaxSuffixComponents</samp>, <samp>Exclude</samp>, and <samp>ChildSelector</samp> selectors removed (as a consequence of the data retrieval semantics change) </li>
<li>
<samp>AnswerOriginKind</samp> selector removed, as a consequence of data packet semantics change </li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.5">"HopLimit" to kill interest loops in special cases </p>
<p><strong>CCNx 1.0</strong> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.7">CCNx 1.0 uses a HopLimit field in the fixed header of Interest packets. This field restricts an Interest to at most 255 hops, so a loop will eventually terminate. An Interest loop would likely terminate faster than that because once it completes its first cycle it would either find a Pending Interest Table entry that aggregates it (suppressing forwarding it) or it finds a ContentStore entry that satisfies it. The vulnerability to longer loops occurs when PIT entries get satisfied faster than the loop period and the Content Object is either not cachable or a node has no cache or its cache entry gets evicted too fast.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.8">CCNx 1.0 also recommends decrementing the Interest Lifetime by an appropriate amount at each hop, which also serves to limit looping.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.9">CCNx 1.0 assumes that routing protcocols produce routes without permanent loops.  </p>
<p><strong>Uses of HopLimit</strong> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.11">An option to scope interest forwarding using HopLimit field. CCNx 1.0 informally maintains the CCNx 0.x conventions of /localhost, but that convention is not in the standard.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.12">CCNx 1.0 has not adopted a /localhop convention because it can be achieved via the HopLimit. We also believe that each link should be uniquely named to avoid confusion in the FIB and ContentStore.  Clearly, /localhop prefixed names cannot use FIB forwarding and they cannot be stored in a common ContentStore.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.4">There is one packet envelope with optional Validation on both Interest and Content Validation can be a MIC, MAC, or Signature.  We allow formats like a CRC, an HMAC, Elliptical Curve, and RSA.  We also allow unsigned packets, which are used when trust is achieved via hash chains from a previously signed packet.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.5">Validation only covers the Message and the ValidationAlg, not the optional headers or fixed header.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.6">CCNx 1.0 allows signing Interests. This is usually to allow a CRC on Interest to protect against in-network corruption. However, the Interest may be signed via a stronger signature within an application usage. CCNx does not recommend signing or processing signed Interest when the application protocol is not expecting such, as this is a computational denial of service vector.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.7">The CCNx KeyExchange (CCNxKE) protocol (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wood-icnrg-ccnxkeyexchange-01) is an on-line key exchange protocol similar to TLS 1.3 to negotiate encryption keys. We believe this form of session security is intrinsically useful and should be supported within an ICN, even though other forms of off-line publishing encryption may be used in other cases.  </p>
