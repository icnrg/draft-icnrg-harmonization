# Introduction

Content-Centric Networking version 1.0 (CCNx 1.0) and Named Data Networking (NDN) are two prominent realizations of the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) vision.
Both realizations share the same roots of Content Centric Networking (CCN) idea introduced by [Van Jacobson in 2006](http://www.ccnx.org/395/1/van-jacobsen-at-google/).
<!-- CCNx -->
<!-- Up until version 0.8, CCNx was a prototype of the NDN/CCN architecture. -\-> -->
CCNx, from versions 0.1 to 0.8 (referred to as CCNx 0.x in the rest of this draft), was the name of the software router and libraries developed and maintained by PARC.
Although the protocol architecture was renamed to NDN when the effort got funded under NSFâ€™s Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program in 2010 (PARC being one of the ten funded institutions), the NDN project used CCNx 0.x as its implementation codebase in its first two years of operation.  

However PARC and the rest of the NDN project team started parting the way in late 2012 (interested readers may take a look of [the related causes](https://named-data.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/NDN-IPR.pdf).
PARC introduced a significantly re-designed, non backward compatible protocol CCNx 1.0. In parallel the NDN project team continued to refine the NDN protocol, which is derived from the original CCNx 0.x design, based on experimentation results and the [NDN protocol design principles](https://named-data.net/project/ndn-design-principles/).

The objective of this document is to summarize the shared commonalities between the latest versions of CCNx and NDN realizations, identify points of divergence, and documents reasons behind these different design choices.
The identified commonalities and differences serve as a starting point to an open discussion to determine possibility to "harmonize" the two realizations, and if determined so, provide a general guidance on how to achieve it.
